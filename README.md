# Lending_club_capstone
This is captone project for lending club loan data.
Lending club is a platform of person-to-person loan. Lending club loan data was downloaded from kaggle website, which include a complete record of loan issued between 2007-2015.
I selected a loan subset from kaggle that are currently under payment. These loan were issued between 2010-12-01 and 2015-12-01. Their last payment date no later than 2016-01-01. 
This project aims to predict which loan will fail to make next payment.
A different version of loan data was downloaded from Lending Club website, including updated payment date records and loan status, which enable me to define labels for next payment prediction.
